# Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition Binary
In this project, we will use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits zero and one.
<br />

## Packages used in this project:
- numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- matplotlib is a popular library to plot graphs in Python.
- tensorflow a popular platform for machine learning.
